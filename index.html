                            <h5>Coding:</h5>
                            Recently took some time to learn javascript to build this website. 
                            I also built a simple web-app that keeps track of our receipts
                            and calculates who owes who what. Building the monthly bills app 
                            was especially interesting since I had to build the backend API
                            using flask. Now that I have figured out the general structure
                            of building web-apps with some very basic tools, I want to try
                            building a website to host data I scrape on freelancer rates.

                            <h5>Data Infrastructure:</h5>
                            At work I've spent a week setting up some data infrastructure.
                            What I mean by 'infrastructure' is setting up my bash environment,
                            enabling conda environments, and starting to develop an internal
                            package. All of this was complicated by the fact that my datascience
                            is done an a windows server with no internet access!

                                I'm currently trying to estimate the predictive validity of
                                a tool where the users, for whom I'm making predictions, 
                                received an intervention before the prediction period was over.
                                For example, we want to predict if a user will come back to our
                                site within a month based on some user characteristics. However,
                                we find out that halfway through the month the user received an
                                email from marketing notifying them about some information. How 
                                do you validate the predictive power of your model in this instance?
                            </p>

                                I'm also working on a review of the heterogenous treatment
                                effects estimation literature. I know of some obvious
                                examples by Susan Athey, but now I'm trying to felsh out the 
                                literature. This should be an interesting exercise.
