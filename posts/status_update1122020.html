                            <h5>Coding:</h5>
                            I read hacker news relatively frequently and a book that I kept seeing
                            mentioned was "Clean Code" by Robert Martin. For those -- like me --
                            who were unaware of this book, it seems to be recommended as a guide
                            on how to structure your code with a focus on making the code easily 
                            maintainable and something that can be built on. So far, I think of it
                            as a guide on how to structure your code as you would the mass of wires
                            that feed all the electronics on your desk. When the wires become tangled
                            and intertwined it makes adding a new cable (or changing out an old one)
                            very difficult and time consuming. Instead, you want to bundle your wires
                            and organize them so you can quickly and easily find the old wire add 
                            change it out. Overall, excited to work through this book.

                            <h5>Data Science Infrastructure:</h5>
                            In my last update I had spent some time building a local conda channel 
                            on my internet-less work server, to much success. After getting a library channel for Python
                            working I then turned to R with the goal of creating a repo on the server so I can 
                            easily control package versions and update them 
                            when I want. It turns out that this process is more 
                            difficult than Python, largely because you have to do it from R directly.
                            In order to make this process easier I built a small command line tool, 
                            which I creatively call 'miniCRAN_cli', that is a wrapper around the 
                            R 'miniCRAN' package. Check it out on my github:

                            <p>
                                I've now spent a significant amount of time investigating 
                                the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects estimation, and 
                                I'm finding the amount of literature to be impressive. At the highest level,
                                there are a grouping of methods known as "meta-algorithms" or "meta-learners"
                                that seem to be popularly used for uplift modeling in marketing. For each
                                type of learner, one can spend a significant amount of time reading papers 
                                where each one customizes a supervised learning tool to better estimate
                                heterogeneity of treatment effects. Unfortunately, all this noise is 
                                distracting and makes it unclear as to how useful the very fancy methods 
                                really are. I've also noticed that almost all of these methods are 
                                built for experimental data and very little attention has been given 
                                to selection on unobservables. I can definitely understand why this 
                                is the case, but it's unfortunate because it means these methods are 
                                not going to be useful for where I currently work.
